# Scouter Phase 1A

Scouter Phase 1A is the local-only Shelly widget MVP from `scouter-spec-v3.1.md`.

## Implemented

- Native Scouter core models:
  - `ScouterEvent`
  - `SessionSnapshot`
  - `ScouterSource`
  - `ScouterStatus`
- Local hook server:
  - binds only to `127.0.0.1`
  - picks a dynamic port on start
  - requires `X-Scouter-Token`
- Hook endpoints:
  - `POST /hook/cc/<event>`
  - `POST /hook/codex/<event>`
  - `POST /hook/<event>`
- JSONL polling fallback:
  - `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
  - `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- Shelly state bridge:
  - minimal adapter over native terminal sessions
- State storage:
  - SharedPreferences JSON snapshots
  - latest session drives the widget
- Medium 4x2 AppWidget:
  - event-driven `AppWidgetManager.updateAppWidget`
  - no short-period `updatePeriodMillis`
  - tap opens the in-app Scouter monitor through `shelly://scouter`
- Basic notifications:
  - completed
  - error
  - long-running tool activity after 120 seconds while Shelly remains alive
- Minimal settings/debug controls:
  - gear menu -> `SCOUTER`
  - `shelly config` -> `Scouter` -> `Scouter Widget`
  - `Open Scouter monitor`
  - native terminal helper: `shelly scouter status|hooks`
  - `Scouter Debug Info`
  - `Scouter Hook Template`

## Not Implemented

- Foreground Scouter service
- approval/deny notification actions
- Wear OS
- Small/Large widgets
- polished UI, animation, or screenshot tooling
- high-precision token/cost accounting
- automatic CC/Codex settings injection
- process-death survival without reopening Shelly

## Manual Verification

1. Build and install Shelly.
2. Open the top-right gear menu.
3. Enable `SCOUTER` -> `Scouter`.
4. Tap `Scouter Debug Info` and verify:
   - `enabled: true`
   - `port` is greater than zero
   - `hookTokenPreview` is present
5. Open a fresh Shelly terminal and verify the native helper:

```sh
cat ~/.bashrc_version
type shelly
shelly scouter status
shelly scouter hooks
```

Expected:

- `~/.bashrc_version` is `141` or newer
- `type shelly` prints a shell function that invokes `$HOME/bin/shelly`
- `shelly scouter status` prints cached state from `~/.scouter-state.json`
- `shelly scouter hooks` prints the full hook token and base URLs

6. Tap `Copy hook templates` to copy the exact runtime token and endpoints, or use `shelly scouter hooks`.
7. Add the `Scouter` widget to the Android home screen.
8. Send a test event from a Shelly terminal:

```sh
PORT=<port from Scouter Debug Info>
TOKEN=<token from Copy hook templates>
curl -sS \
  -H "X-Scouter-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"manual-test","cwd":"/home/shelly/demo","toolName":"Bash","toolInput":{"command":"echo hi"},"source":"claude"}' \
  "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/hook/cc/pre-tool-use"
```

Expected:

- `{"ok":true}` from curl
- widget updates to show `demo`, `CC`, and `Bash`

8. Send a completion event:

```sh
curl -sS \
  -H "X-Scouter-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"manual-test","cwd":"/home/shelly/demo","source":"claude"}' \
  "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/hook/cc/stop"
```

Expected:

- widget status color changes to completed/idle and the previous tool label is cleared
- basic completion notification is posted if notification permission is granted

## Hook Template Shape

The native debug action returns the runtime base URL and token. Use that output to generate real Claude Code/Codex hook settings. Phase 1A intentionally leaves automatic settings injection to a later Shelly integration pass.

Example endpoint layout:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/user-prompt
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/pre-tool-use
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/post-tool-use
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/post-tool-use-failure
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/notification
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/pre-compact
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc/stop

http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/codex/user-prompt
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/codex/pre-tool-use
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/codex/permission-request
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/codex/post-tool-use
http://127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/codex/stop
```

Every request must include:

```text
X-Scouter-Token: <hookToken>
```

## Known Runtime Limits

- Phase 1A intentionally does not use a foreground service. The hook server and JSONL watcher run while the Shelly app process is alive. If Android kills or force-stops Shelly, Scouter restarts only after Shelly is opened again.
- The hook server port is dynamic per Scouter process lifetime. After Shelly is restarted, old copied hook URLs can fail with `curl: (7) Failed to connect`; run `shelly scouter hooks` or use the gear debug action again to get the current port.
- The loopback server accepts local device traffic only (`127.0.0.1`), requires `X-Scouter-Token`, caps request bodies at 64 KiB, and uses a small fixed request pool.
- Debug output redacts the token. `Copy hook templates` intentionally copies the full token because CC/Codex hook setup needs it.
- Disabling Scouter clears widget snapshots so the widget falls back to the waiting state.
- The native terminal `shelly` helper reads cached status/hooks from `~/.scouter-state.json`. ON/OFF remains a gear-menu action because starting/stopping the hook server requires the in-process Android service. Gear-menu debug is authoritative for live in-memory service state.
- The helper is exposed as a bash function instead of executing `$HOME/bin/shelly` directly. Some Samsung/Android app-private filesystems returned `/system/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Success` for direct shebang execution.

## Device Verification Log

2026-05-16 dogfood candidate, Galaxy Z Fold6 + One UI Home:

- `SCOUTER` gear controls are visible and can enable Scouter.
- `shelly scouter hooks` works from a fresh Shelly terminal after `~/.bashrc_version` `141`.
- Runtime hooks expose `127.0.0.1:<dynamic-port>/hook/cc` and `/hook/codex` with `X-Scouter-Token`.
- Manual Claude-style `pre-tool-use` request returns `{"ok":true}` and updates the widget to show the test session, `CC`, and `Bash`.
- Manual `stop` request returns `{"ok":true}`; terminal states no longer leave a stale `Bash` tool label on the widget.
- One UI can add the Medium widget after the RemoteViews layout avoids unsupported raw `View` children.
- Reusing an old hook URL after app/process restart correctly fails because Phase 1A does not keep a foreground service alive and the port is regenerated.

## Widget Display

The Medium widget shows the latest session snapshot observed by Scouter, not necessarily the currently focused Shelly tab.

- Title: source and project, for example `Claude Code · demo`, `Codex · hw`, or `Shelly · home`.
- Badge: compact source code, `CC`, `CX`, or `SH`.
- Status line: human-readable state, for example `Running Bash in demo`, `Thinking in hw`, `Waiting in home`, `Completed in demo`, or `Error in demo`.
- Footer: optional cost/tokens/context, followed by `Last event HH:mm:ss`.

Long Android private paths are shortened for readability. For example, the Shelly terminal home path is displayed as `home` instead of the full app-private directory.

If the latest event is more than 10 minutes old, the widget marks the snapshot as `Stale`. Phase 1A+ still avoids short-period widget polling, so stale state appears on the next event-driven render, manual refresh, or launcher-driven widget refresh.

## Scouter Monitor

Tap the Medium widget, or use gear menu -> `SCOUTER` -> `Open Scouter monitor`.

The monitor is the inspection layer for Phase 1A+:

- Service status: Scouter ON/OFF, hook server port, JSONL watcher, token preview.
- Latest session: source, project, status, last event, duration, token/cost/context hints, and last error.
- Session list: up to the latest 20 snapshots stored by Scouter.
- Hook URLs: current Claude Code and Codex hook base URLs.
- Copy hooks: copies runtime hook templates with the full token.

The monitor auto-refreshes while open. Widget remains the glance layer and intentionally shows only the latest observed session.

## JSONL Parser Pack v1

Scouter now includes a small native parser pack based on the data shapes used by `ccusage`, `Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor`, and the same Codex `token_count` conventions used by `ccusage codex`.

Claude Code JSONL support:

- reads `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
- tracks `message.model`
- aggregates `message.usage.input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`
- uses `costUSD` when Claude Code writes it
- extracts the latest assistant text and latest `tool_use.name`

Codex JSONL support:

- reads `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- tracks model and cwd updates from `turn_context`
- aggregates `event_msg` / `token_count` entries
- prefers deltas from `total_token_usage` to avoid duplicate `token_count` rows, and uses `last_token_usage` only when no cumulative total is available
- treats `cached_input_tokens` as cache-read tokens without adding them again to total tokens

The JSONL watcher starts existing files from their current end to avoid replaying old CC/Codex history on every Scouter restart. New or recently modified files are tailed from the first complete line, and incomplete trailing JSONL records are left for the next scan.

Phase 1A+ deliberately does not yet implement full ccusage-style daily/monthly reporting, model pricing lookup, or Claude request-id deduplication. The parser pack is scoped to live session display: model, token totals, cache totals, cost when available, latest message, latest tool, and status.

Dogfood checklist for the first week:

- Keep the Medium widget on the home screen and watch stale-state behavior after screen off, app switch, and app restart.
- Run `shelly scouter hooks` after opening Shelly before testing hooks, because copied ports are process-local.
- Observe notification volume for completed/error/long-running events.
- Watch whether newly started CC/Codex sessions appear without old-history noise after Shelly/Scouter restart.
- Decide before Phase 1B whether the no-foreground-service constraint is still acceptable for real hook reliability.

## PoC 5A Notes

Phase 1A includes the native surface needed for later command injection but does not implement command injection. The current Shelly native PTY layer already exposes `TerminalEmulator.writeToSession(sessionId, text)`, which is the likely path for Shelly-managed sessions.

Open items for the dedicated PoC:

- map Scouter `sessionId` to Shelly native PTY session id
- confirm CC accepts normal prompt text through PTY stdin 20/20 times
- confirm Codex accepts normal prompt text through PTY stdin 20/20 times
- separately test permission prompt allow/deny before adding notification actions
